# Diced

Currently has basic dice functionality but looking to expand into an all purpose DnD tool to make dice roll easier. This is the first project that I have really tried to work on for an extended time so patience and always apreciated. It you have other ideas for what I can add consult the list below before recomending.

Current projects:
  - Conjure Animals
  - Conjure Woodland Beings

Future Projects
  - Mass Combat
      - Mass advantage/disadvantage
  - Damage averaging
  - Tasha's summon spells
  - Natrual lannuage processing
  - UI
  - Markov chain character prompts

# Installation

In very early devolopment there is not way to meaningfully interact with the code but you can always just steal the language to dice roll code if you want.
